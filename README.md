# TEST PAGE ~ jQuery Application Test

## homework eight

Build of a basc site made using jQuery and some basic Java code to load paged dynamically as opposed to using several html files. It makes the folder more organized, it is a bit of a pain in the neck to set everything up in the app file though. Possible to just use html first then set it in the app, but that defeats the purpose a bit. Otherwise there wasn't really much that was too difficult to manage in regards to the site, so everything was set up pretty easily. Had a more fancy idea in mind, but had to sort of put something simpler together once I had to switch to a new computer.
